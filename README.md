# pythonScripts
A collection of old python scripts for easy reference.
Most of them are host side scripts that would run on an Apache server I configured to fetch data and return some HTML to the client, but some are for other things like G-Code file manipulation and general automation.
Comments in the individual files will say exactly what they were for.
